					<h3>
					    <strong>16. User Services</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
					    Upon the Employer awarding a project or Question to the Provider, and the Provider&#39;s acceptance on the Website, or the purchase of an item by an Employer from the Provider, the Employer and Provider will be deemed to have entered into a User Contract under which the Employer agrees to purchase, and the Provider agrees to deliver the Provider Services. You agree not to enter into any contractual provisions in conflict with the User Agreement.
					</p>
					<p>
					    You are solely responsible for ensuring that you comply with your obligations to other Users. If you do not, you may become liable to that User. You must ensure that you are aware of any domestic laws (including common law), international laws, statutes, ordinances and regulations relevant to you as an Employer or Provider, or in any other uses you make of the Website.
					</p>
					<p>
					    If another User breaches any obligation to you, you are solely responsible for enforcing any rights that you may have. For the avoidance of doubt, we have no responsibility for enforcing any rights under a User Contract.
					</p>
					<p>
					    Depending on their jurisdiction, Providers and Employers may have rights under statutory warranties that cannot lawfully be excluded. Nothing in this User Agreement is intended to override a right that by applicable law may not be excluded.
					</p>
					<p>
					    Each User acknowledges and agrees that the relationship between Employers and Providers is that of an independent contractor. Nothing in this User Agreement creates a partnership, joint venture, agency or employment relationship between Users. Nothing in this User Agreement shall in any way be construed as forming a joint venture, partnership or an employer-employee relationship between Regbuzz and the User.
					</p>
					<h3>
					    <strong>17. Special provisions for Local Jobs</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
					    Each User acknowledges:
					</p>
					<p>
					    Regbuzz may from time to time include a map feature and Regbuzz may display the location of Users to persons browsing the Website on that map. Every Employer seeking services for Local jobs will be asked to provide the location where the Local job is to be performed or the goods are to be delivered. A User must never disclose, in any Project posted, personal details such as the User&#39;s name, street number, phone number or the email address in any Project description for a Local job or in any other public communication on the Regbuzz Website.
					</p>
					<p>
					    Once a Provider&#39;s bid has been accepted by an Employer seeking Local jobs services or tasks then the Provider providing the service or task is obliged to complete the transaction, unless the service or task, goods or transaction is prohibited by law, by this Agreement or by any of our Policies.
					</p>
					<p>
					    If an Employer updates a Local job after it has been published on the Website, then all bids for that Local job made prior to the update will be automatically cancelled and the bidding process will restart. When a Provider has provided the goods or services or completed the task requested by an Employer seeking services for Local job, the User must log on to the Website and click the &quot;Complete&quot; button for that Local job. Failure to complete the service or task will constitute a breach of this User Agreement.
					</p>
					<p>
					    Our fees are applied to the amount of the awarded Provider&#39;s bid to perform the services for the Local job. Any items purchased by the Provider as part of performing the service are between the Employer and Provider.
					</p>
					<h3>
					    <strong>18. Funds</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
					    You may have funds in your Account if you have prepaid for fees or charges or for services to be provided to you via the Website. If you are a Provider, you may have funds if you have successfully completed a Project, or sold an item, and funds have been released to you. There are also circumstances where funds will have been credited to your Account in relation to an affiliate program or a referral program.
					</p>
					<p>
					    Funds in your Account are held by us in our operating accounts held with reputable financial institutions. Funds in your Account are not held separately by us and may be commingled with our general operating funds and funds of other User&#39;s Accounts.
					</p>
					<p>
					    You are not entitled to any interest, or other earnings for funds that are in your Account.
					</p>
					<p>
					    We may receive interest on funds held by us in our operating accounts (which may include funds in your Account) from financial institutions with whom we hold our operating accounts. Any such interest earned belongs to us and we will not be liable to any User for any imputed interest on such funds.
					</p>
					<p>
					    If your Account has a negative amount of funds, we may:
					</p>
					<ul class="onStyled">
						<li>set-off the negative amount of funds with funds that you subsequently receive into your Account;</li>
						<li>if you have funds in multiple currencies in your Account and one of the currencies becomes negative for any reason, we may set-off the negative amount against funds you maintain in a different currency balance (at an exchange rate applied by us);</li>
						<li>reverse payments you have made from your Account to other User Accounts on the Website;</li>
						<li>deduct amounts you owe us from money you subsequently add or receive into your Account; or</li>
						<li>immediately suspend or limit your Account until such time as your Account no longer has a negative amount.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
					    In the event that we offset a negative amount of funds pursuant to this section, it may be bundled with another debit coming out of your Account.
					</p>
					<p>
					    We reserve the right to collect any funds owed to us by any other legal means.
					</p>
					<p>
					    You acknowledge and agree that:
					</p>
					<ul class="onStyled">
						<li>we are not a bank or other licensed financial institution and do not provide banking services or any financial services to you;</li>
						<li>the funds shown in your Account (which may include Milestone Payments and/or any prepayment of fees and charges which you owe to us) represents our unsecured obligations to you with respect to your rights to direct us to make payment in relation to the purchase and sale of Provider Services through the Website and provision of the Regbuzz Services;</li>
						<li>to the extent that we are required to release funds from your Account to you, you will become our unsecured creditor until such funds are paid to you;</li>
						<li>we are not acting as a trustee or fiduciary with respect to such funds or payments;</li>
						<li>the amount of funds showing in your Account is not insured and is not a guaranteed deposit;</li>
						<li>funds may only loaded into your Account, or released from your Account, by us and you must only use the mechanisms available on the Website to pay for, or receive funds in respect of Provider Services;</li>
						<li>we will hold funds in respect of the amount of your Account (including Milestone Payments) in an account held by us with a financial institution (or in any manner that we decide in our sole discretion from time to time) and such funds are not segregated into a separate account; and</li>
						<li>we may commingle your funds with funds of other User&#39;s and our own funds and such commingled funds could be used to pay other Users or for our general corporate purposes or otherwise, however, we will remain obliged to release or refund funds at your direction in accordance with this User Agreement.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>
					    <strong>19. Limits &amp; Fraud Prevention</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
					    We reserve the right to suspend a User withdrawal request if the source of the funds is suspected to be fraudulent.
					</p>
					<p>
					    If we become aware that any funds received into an Account from another Account as a result of a fraudulent transaction (e.g. paid a Milestone Payment using a stolen credit card) it will be reversed immediately. If those funds have already been released to you, you must pay the funds into your Account. If you do not do so, we may suspend, limit or cancel your account, or take action against you to recover those funds.
					</p>
					<p>
					    We may, in our sole discretion, place a limit on any or all of the funds in your Account (thereby preventing any use of the funds) if:
					</p>
					<ul class="onStyled">
						<li>we believe there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your Account, or any or all of your transactions, including if we believe that there is a risk that such funds will be subject to reversal or chargeback;</li>
						<li>we believe that the beneficiary of the payment is someone other than you;</li>
						<li>we believe that the payment is being made to a country where we do not offer our Service; or</li>
						<li>we are required to do so by law.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
					    If you are involved in a dispute, we may (in certain circumstances) place a temporary limit on the funds in your Account to cover the amount of any potential liability. If the dispute is resolved in your favour, we will lift the limit on your funds and those funds may be released to you. If the dispute is not resolved in your favour, we may remove the funds from your Account.
					</p>
					<h3>
					    <strong>20. Refunds</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
					    You may ask for a refund at any time for any funds that you have paid into your Account except if the amount to refund relates to fees or charges payable to us.
					</p>
					<p>
					    If the amount the User has asked to refund relates to our fees and charges, the process set out in the Clause &quot;Disputes with Us&quot; must be followed.
					</p>
					<p>
					    If we agree to the refund, the funds will be received by the User via the same payment method(s) that the User used to make the original payment to us. We may, in our sole discretion, use an alternative payment method in exceptional circumstances.
					</p>
					<p>
					    We may refund funds to Users irrespective of whether a User has requested funds be refunded if: (1) we are required by law or consider that we are required by law to do so; (2) we determine that refunding funds to the User will avoid any dispute or an increase in our costs; (3) we refund funds to the User in accordance with any refund policy specified by us from time to time; (4) we find out that the original payment made by the User is fraudulent; (5) the User made a duplicate payment in error; or (6) we consider, in our sole opinion, that it is likely that the refund of funds is necessary to avoid a credit card chargeback.
					</p>
					<p>
					    You can request a refund by using our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.freelancer.com/users/helpdesk.php"><span>customer support website</span></a>&nbsp;or emailing us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@freelancer.com"><span>support@Regbuzz.com</span></a>. If you have done so, you must not initiate a chargeback request with your credit card issuer until such time as all reasonable efforts have been exhausted with us to resolve your request.
					</p>
					<p>
					    If you have already initiated a chargeback request with your credit card issuer, you must not request a refund of funds by contacting us and must not seek double recovery.
					</p>
					<p>
					    If we reasonably determine, having considered all the relevant circumstances, that you have made an excessive or unreasonable number of requests to refund funds back to you or chargebacks, we may suspend, limit or close your Account.
					</p>
					<p>
					    There is no minimum amount for a refund.
					</p>
					<h3>
					    <strong>21. Withdrawals</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
					    Your first withdrawal of funds earned will be delayed for fifteen days for security and fraud purposes.
					</p>
					<p>
					    Subsequent withdrawals may be delayed for up to fifteen days where our fraud prevention policies dictate that a delay is required.
					</p>
					<p>
					    We impose a minimum withdrawal amount for funds earned. This is set out in our schedule of&nbsp;“<a href="https://www.freelancer.com/feesandcharges"><span>Fees and Charges</span></a>”.
					</p>
					<p>
					    We may require you to be Regbuzz Verified before you can withdraw funds from your Regbuzz account, irrespective of whether or not a delay has been enforced..
					</p>
					<p>
					    You acknowledge and agree that we may seek to verify your identity or request additional information from you as part of our anti-fraud and Know Your Customer policy, as outlined in the section on &quot;Identity / Know Your Customer&quot; in this agreement.
					</p>
					<h3>
					    <strong>22. Chargebacks</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
					    A chargeback (being a challenge to a payment that an Employer files directly with their credit card issuer) and a reversal instruction is made by the payment product issuer or third parties (such as payment processors) and not by us. We are bound to follow their instructions.
					</p>
					<p>
					    You acknowledge and agree that we will be entitled to recover chargebacks and reversals that may be imposed on us by a payment product issuer or third parties (such as payment processors) on funds paid to you by Employers through the Website.
					</p>
					<p>
					    You agree that we may reverse any such payments made to you, which are subject to chargeback or reversal instruction via your payment product issuer or third parties (such as payment processors).
					</p>
					<h3>
					    <strong>23. Right To Refuse Service</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
					    We may close, suspend or limit your access to your Account without reason. Without limiting the foregoing, we may close, suspend or limit your access to your Account:
					</p>
					<ul class="onStyled">
						<li>if we determine that you have breached, or are acting in breach of, this User Agreement;</li>
						<li>if you under-bid on any Project in an attempt to renegotiate the actual price privately, avoiding fees;</li>
						<li>if we determine that you have breached legal liabilities (actual or potential), including infringing someone else&#39;s Intellectual Property Rights;</li>
						<li>if we determine that you have engaged, or are engaging, in fraudulent, or illegal activities;</li>
						<li>you do not respond to account verification requests;</li>
						<li>you do not complete account verification when requested within 3 months of the date of request;</li>
						<li>you are the subject of a United Nations, Australian, EU or USA sanctions regime, or our banking and payment relationships otherwise preclude us from conducting business with you;</li>
						<li>to manage any risk of loss to us, a User, or any other person; or</li>
						<li>for other similar reasons.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
					    If we close your Account due to your breach of this User Agreement, you may also become liable for certain fees as described in this User Agreement.
					</p>
					<p>
					    Without limiting our other remedies, to the extent you have breached this User Agreement, you must pay us all fees owed to us and reimburse us for all losses and costs (including any and all of our employee time) and reasonable expenses (including legal fees) related to investigating such breach and collecting such fees.
					</p>
					<p>
					    You acknowledge and agree that: (1) the damages that we will sustain as a result of your breach of this User Agreement will be substantial and will potentially include (without limitation) fines and other related expenses imposed on us by our payment processors and Users and that those damages may be extremely difficult and impracticable to ascertain; (2) if you breach this User Agreement, we may fine you up to US$3,000 for each breach and/or we may take legal action against you to recover losses that are in excess of the fine amount; (3) a fine of up to US$3,000 is a presently reasonable pre-estimate or minimum estimate of our damages, considering all currently existing circumstances, including (without limitation) the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to us that reasonably could be anticipated and the anticipation that proof of actual damages may be impractical or extremely difficult; and (4) we may release the entire (or part of the) amount of the fine from your Account to us.
					</p>
					<p>
					    If we close your Account for a reason other than as a result of your breach of this User Agreement, unless as otherwise specified in this User Agreement, you will be entitled to receive any payment due from us to you.
					</p>
					<p>
					    In the event that we close your Account, you will have no claim whatsoever against us in respect of any such suspension or termination of your Account.
					</p>
					<h3>

					    <strong>25. Disputes With Us</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
					    If a dispute arises between you and Regbuzz, our goal is to address your concerns and, if we are unable to do so to your satisfaction, to provide you with a means of resolving the dispute quickly. We strongly encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a resolution by using our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.freelancer.com/users/helpdesk.php"><span>customer support website</span></a>or emailing us at<a href="mailto:support@freelancer.com"><span style="color:#333333;text-underline:none">support@Regbuzz.com</span></a>.
					</p>
					<p>
					    For any claim, Regbuzz may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. If Regbuzz elects arbitration, such arbitration will be initiated through an established alternative dispute resolution (ADR) provider, which is to be selected by you from a panel of ADR providers that Regbuzz will provide to you. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

					<h3>
					    <strong>26. Currencies</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
					    Some of the Websites will display rates in the local currency of that Website, in addition to the actual amount. These rates are based on a conversion from the originating currency using indicative market exchange rates. You understand and agree that these rates are only indicative and the amount specified in the origin currency is the actual amount.
					</p>
					<p>
					    As a convenience service, you may withdraw funds from the Website in another currency. If you wish to do so, you will be quoted an exchange rate which will be available for the time specified, which you may choose to accept. We may charge a fee for effecting the currency conversion transactions. This fee will be embedded within the rate provided to you and the currency exchange will be settled immediately.
					</p>
					<p>
					    We reserve the right to reject any request for a conversion of currency at any time.
					</p>
					<p>
					    You are responsible for all risks associated with converting and maintaining funds in various available currencies, including but not limited to the risk that the value of these funds will fluctuate as exchange rates change, which could result in decreases in the value of your funds in aggregate. You must not use (or attempt to use) the Website to engage in speculative trading, which could result in substantial losses. We are not a financial services provider.
					</p>
					<p>
					    All information included on the Website in respect of currency conversion is general information only. Use of currency conversion is at your own risk. Currency conversions are final and irreversible.

We have no liability for loss suffered by a User in connection with a Question including but not limited to loss suffered (or penalties imposed) in connection with a contravention of law.
					</p>
					<p>
					    Employers can promote either: (1) a regular prepaid Question, under which an Employer may select one or more winning Entrant(s) and Employers may request that the Question Prize be released to them if a winner has not been chosen within 30 days of the Question closing date; or (2) a guaranteed Question, under which a Employer may select one or more winning Provider(s) and if no winner is selected, we will release the Question Prize to Entrants of the guaranteed Question and charge the appropriate fees and the Employer will have no rights to have the Question Prize released to them or to use any entries that have been submitted.

					    Because User identification on the internet is difficult, we cannot and do not confirm each User&#39;s purported identity. We may provide information about a User, such as a strength or risk score, geographical location, or third party background check or verification of identity or credentials. However, such information is based solely on data that the User submits and we provide such information solely for the convenience of Users and the provision of such information is not an introduction, endorsement or recommendation by us.

					</p>
					<p>
					    Our Services, the Website and all content on it are provided on an &#39;as is&#39;, &#39;with all faults&#39; and &#39;as available&#39; basis and without warranties of any kind either express or implied. Without limiting the foregoing, we make no representation or warranty about:

						<li>the Website or any Provider Services or Regbuzz Services;</li>
						<li>the accuracy, reliability, availability, veracity, timeliness or content of the Website or any Provider Services or Regbuzz Services;</li>
						<li>whether the Website or Provider Services or Regbuzz Services will be up-to-date, uninterrupted, secure, error-free or non-misleading;</li>
						<li>whether defects in the Website will be corrected;</li>

					</ul>

					<p>
					    To the extent permitted by law, we specifically disclaim any implied warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quality, suitability and non-infringement.
					</p>
					<h3>
					    <strong>38. Limitation Of Liability</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
					    In no event shall we, our related entities, our affiliates or staff be liable, whether in contract, warranty, tort (including negligence), or any other form of liability, for:
					</p>
					<ul class="onStyled">
						<li>any indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages that may be incurred by you;</li>
						<li>any loss of income, business or profits (whether direct or indirect) that may be incurred by you;</li>
						<li>any claim, damage, or loss which may be incurred by you as a result of any of your transactions involving the Website.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
					    The limitations on our liability to you above shall apply whether or not we, our related entities, our affiliates or staffs have been advised of the possibility of such losses or damages arising.
					</p>
					<p>
					    Notwithstanding the above provisions, nothing in this User Agreement is intended to limit or exclude any liability on the part of us and our affiliates and related entities where and to the extent that applicable law prohibits such exclusion or limitation.
					</p>
					<p>
					    To the extent that we are able to limit the remedies available under this User Agreement, we expressly limit our liability for breach of a non-excludable condition or warranty implied by virtue of any legislation to the following remedies (the choice of which is to be at our sole discretion) to the supply of the Regbuzz services again or the payment of the cost of having the Regbuzz services supplied again.
					</p>
					<h3>
					    <strong>39. Jurisdiction Limitations</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
					    As some jurisdictions do not allow some of the exclusions or limitations as established above, some of these exclusions or limitations may not apply to you. In that event, the liability will be limited as far as legally possible under the applicable legislation.
					</p>
					<h3>
					    <strong>40. Bar To Action</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
					    We may plead this User Agreement in bar to any claim, action, proceeding or suit brought by you, against us for any matter arising out of any transaction or otherwise in respect of this User Agreement.
					</p>
					<h3>
					    <strong>41. No Class Actions</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
					    You and we agree that you and we will only be permitted to bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding. Unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person&#39;s or party&#39;s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding. In addition, the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favour of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party&#39;s individual claim(s). Any relief awarded cannot affect other Users.
					</p>
					<h3>
					    <strong>42. Notices</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
					    Legal notices must be served on Regbuzz (in the case of Regbuzz) or to the email address you provide to Regbuzz during the registration process (in your case). Notice will be deemed given 24 hours after email is sent, unless the sending party is notified that the email address is invalid or that the email has not been delivered. Alternatively, we may give you legal notice by mail to the address provided by you during the registration process. In such case, notice will be deemed given three days after the date of mailing.
					</p>
					<p>
					    Any notices to Regbuzz must be given by registered ordinary post (or if posted to or from a place outside Australia, by registered airmail).
					</p>
					<h3>
					    <strong>43. Law And Forum For Legal Disputes</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
					    This Agreement will be governed in all respects by the laws of China. We encourage you to try and resolve disputes using certified mediation (such as online dispute resolution processes). If a dispute cannot be resolved then you and Regbuzz irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Hangzhou, China.
					</p>
					<h3>
					    <strong>44. Severability</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
					    The provisions of this User Agreement are severable, and if any provision of this User Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision may be removed and the remaining provisions will be enforced. This Agreement may be assigned by us to an associated entity at any time, or to a third party without your consent in the event of a sale or other transfer of some or all of our assets. In the event of any sale or transfer you will remain bound by this User Agreement.
					</p>
					<h3>
					    <strong>45. Interpretation</strong>
					</h3>

					</p>
					<h3>
					    <strong>46. No Waiver</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
					    Our failure to act with respect to an anticipated or actual breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. Nothing in this section shall exclude or restrict your liability arising out of fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.
					</p>
					<h3>
					    <strong>47. Communications</strong>
					</h3>
					<p>
